This is website for studying english
- Search words
    + Searching word and display same format with https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/
- Search by sound, example I search "æ", the website will show me all words that contain this sound
    But not that, there are special cases for tʃ and dʒ, when I search "t", "ʃ", "d" and "ʒ", website shouldn't show words having tʃ and dʒ because the pronunciation is diffeneces
Technical requirements:
- The database should use /Users/huyngo/Documents/personal-folder/study-english-website/words.json file
